Dear Tutor,

I would like to add some supporting information regarding the assignment.

1. For 'Task 1 [adding typing]'  and 'Task 2 [adding docstrings]', as it is a combined tasks, it is performed in all tasks  3-6.

2. For 'Task 3 [using clicks]' - a separate script named **task3.py** is created for demonstrating the click functions.

3. For 'Task 4 [input output]' - a separate script named **task4.py** is created for demonstrating various input/output options.
To eliminate the discrepancy, 'Task 3' and 'Task 4' are made as separate scripts.

4. For 'Task 5 [output output]' - this is performed in the 'Task 3' and 'Task 4' as it combined with the previous ones.

5. For 'Task 6 [shortest path]' - a separate script named **task6.py** is created to demonstrate the shortest path. 


All these scripts were executed and shown in the notebook **Background_Scripts_Implementations.ipynb** 

Thanks for your time.
