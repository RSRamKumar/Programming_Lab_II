Dear Tutor,

Here are some info regarding the Exercise 04 Submission.


1. Task 1 is completed 
Sample Implementation of the Click function.
`python cli.py compile "ppis.csv" "node.csv" "edge.csv"`

2. I am  not able to understand Task 2, and hence not done. 
I understood it to embed all the 3 graphs in a single graph, but unable to implement it.

3. Task 3 is partially done except the part corresponding to the Task 2 continuation.

-  python cli.py stats --ppi_file "ppis.csv" --export "export.csv"

-  python cli.py stats --node_list "new_node_list.tsv" --edge_list "new_edge_list.tsv" --export "export.json"

4. Task 4 modularization was done and the files were named as **network.py** and **cli.py** .



The sample implementations of other methods are commented in the network.py file. 

Thank you!
